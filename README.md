# getting-started

A guide to getting started in the Materials Simulation Group (MSG)
with python, travis, sphinx, github and general scientific computing.

What follows is meant to be an introduction to the tools you skills
you need to be an effective member of the MSG group and become a good
programmer. Most of the things is this guide you will be able to
modify and adapt to fit your own circumstances once you get familiar
with the tools. However, the ideas behind the overall workflow and
design process are not optional as they are the keys to writing good
scientific code.

## The Goal

If you have yet to do so you should contact [Dr. Gus
Hart](http://msg.byu.edu/) to express your interest in joining MSG and
ask him for problems to work through.

Your task, once you have your assigned problems, is to code them up as
a python package with a full suite of [unit
tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), 100% [test
coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage), and [API
documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface). If
you don't know what any of these things mean feel free to follow the
links, or sit tight. They should become clear as we cover each topic
in this walkthrough.

In addition you will be putting your code up on
[github](https://github.com/) and learning the basics of git to create
a repo that will look somewhat similar to this one when you are done.

## Computer Setup

### Github



### Python

In this group we do most of our work through the terminal

## Your First Python Code

Before we even start to write our first program we need to get our
python package setup properly. This will allow us to easily test our
codes as we build them, a process called test driven development, and
ensure the code behaves as we expect.

### Python Packages

To setup your python package follew the instrutions found
[here](instructions/python_package.md).
